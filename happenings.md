## Detailed Descrptions

#### Euregio Data Science Meetup
The Euregio Data Science Meetup is a monthly gathering for Data Enthusiasts of all backgrounds to learn, support and get to know each other in a warm and welcoming atmosphere. The focus is on building connections, helping each other out and learning by doing. You can sign up and find more information about our upcoming meetups [here](https://www.meetup.com/euregio-data-science-meetup/).

#### SCRUM Club Maastricht
The purpose of the SCRUM club is to explore and learn about software/tools for scientific computing and research. A good example of such a tool is R, a free and open-source software environment for statistical computing and graphics. A lot of time is therefore devoted to teaching/learning about R, especially at the beginning. Later on, other topics will be covered and discussed. All club members are invited to suggest topics of interest. You can find the SCRUM Club [here](https://wviechtb.github.io/scrum-club/).
