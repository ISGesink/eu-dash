## Detailed Descrptions
For those of you new to the region, here is an overview with short descriptions of the various initiatives so you can get a better idea about the various possibilities available to you:

#### Euregio Data Science Meetup
The Euregio Data Science Meetup is a monthly activity for Data Enthusiasts of all backgrounds to learn, support and get to know each other in a warm and welcoming atmosphere. The focus is on building connections, helping each other out and learning by doing. You can sign up and find more information about our upcoming meetups [here](https://www.meetup.com/euregio-data-science-meetup/).

#### SCRUM Club Maastricht
The purpose of the SCRUM club is to explore and learn about software/tools for scientific computing and research. A good example of such a tool is R, a free and open-source software environment for statistical computing and graphics. A lot of time is therefore devoted to teaching/learning about R, especially at the beginning. Later on, other topics will be covered and discussed. All club members are invited to suggest topics of interest.
