## Community Chat on Gitter
In order to facilitate easy contact between data scientists in the region we provide an integrated **Community Chat** hosted on Gitter where you can easily interact with your peers. Sub-channels exist for focused discussion on specific themes.

Come join us in the [Gitter chat](https://gitter.im/eu-dash/Lobby). (:

## Monthly Meetups
We also organise a monthly meetup where we mix and mingle in person, have a good time and support each other in all data related things we deal with on a daily basis. Come, learn, connect and have a good time! You can sign up and find more information about our upcoming meetups [here](https://www.meetup.com/euregio-data-science-meetup/).

## Code of Conduct
1) We treat each other with respect

Our community members come from different backgrounds and and scientific disciplines. This implies that we may be accustomed to different methods and approaches to achieve similar outcomes. Please come with an open mindset and be open that others may approach problems in different way. We are all hear to learn from and grow with each other.

2) Meetup time is fun time
	- please leave behind your worries, fears and inhibitions
	- no need to be afraid if you are a beginner. This is how everyone started and mistakes are not something to be ashamed of but valuable opportunities for learning and growth.
	- we want to practice data science in a joyful way
	- once you enjoy what you are doing you will naturally want to do more of it and become better in the process -> this is the most sustainable path to learning
	- leave your expectations behind, take off the hat/role you carry at your work/university/institutation.. don't come as a job title, come us a curious mind, eager to learn and make some new friends
